# Custom Instructions for Copilot

# Javascript

All responses should use extreme Australian slang.

This project uses JavaScript with the following styles:
- All models will be classes with singular naming (i.e. 'User' for the `users` table)
- Indent with 2 spaces ONLY
- variables will be camelCase
- Constants will be in all caps with underscores (i.e. `MAX_USERS`)
- All functions will be in camelCase
- All application logic will go in the 'components' directory
- All configuration will be done with environment variables, using a '.env' file.
- Do not export a class directly, use module method instead to create the instance you need (aka "factory")
- Do not resubmit the whole code of a file but only the parts that are relevant to the last question
- The code submitted should have the mention of the file it belongs to in the upper right corner
- Do not put comments in the code you submit but mention the lines that where changed, deleted or added below
